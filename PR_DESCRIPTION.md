# Fix URL Patterns and Settings Issues

## Overview
This PR fixes critical URL pattern mismatches and settings form issues that were causing NoReverseMatch errors and incorrect redirects.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. NoReverseMatch Error at `/logbook/catalog/1/`
**Problem**: Templates were referencing URL names that didn't match the actual URL patterns defined in `logbook/urls.py`.

**Root Cause**: URL name mismatches between templates and URL patterns:
- `'operations'` → should be `'operations_list'`
- `'create_operations'` → should be `'operations_create'`
- `'update_operations'` → should be `'operations_edit'`
- `'delete_operations'` → should be `'operations_delete'`
- `'update_diagram'` → should be `'diagram_update'`
- `'logbook_batch'` → should be `'entry_batch_create'`
- `'mlfieldbook'` → should be `'logbook_generate'`

**Solution**: Updated all template URL references to match the correct URL pattern names.

### 2. Settings Form Date Field Not Saving
**Problem**: The "Practical Training Start date" field was not saving properly and the form was redirecting to the wrong page.

**Root Causes**:
1. Date field was not properly handling empty values
2. Date value was not being formatted correctly in the template
3. Form was redirecting to `/logbook` instead of `/logbook/logbook_settings`

**Solutions**:
1. Added proper null checking for the date field: `start_date = request.POST.get('start_date', '')`
2. Only save date if it's not empty: `if start_date: student.practical_training_start_date = start_date`
3. Fixed date formatting in template: `value="{% if student.practical_training_start_date %}{{student.practical_training_start_date|date:'Y-m-d'}}{% endif %}"`
4. Fixed redirect to use proper URL name: `return redirect(reverse('logbook_settings'))`

### 3. Hardcoded Redirect URLs
**Problem**: Multiple views were using hardcoded URLs instead of Django's URL reverse function.

**Solution**: Replaced all hardcoded redirects with `reverse()` function calls:
- Added `from django.urls import reverse` import
- Changed `return redirect("/logbook/operations/"+str(logbook_id))` to `return redirect(reverse('operations_list', kwargs={'logbook_id': logbook_id}))`

## Files Modified

### Templates
- `templates/logbook/logbook_detail.html`: Fixed URL references for operations, batch entries, and print functionality
- `templates/logbook/logbook_operations.html`: Fixed URL references for create, edit, delete operations and diagram update
- `templates/logbook/logbook_settings.html`: Fixed date field formatting

### Views
- `logbook/views.py`: 
  - Added proper date field handling in settings view
  - Fixed redirect URLs to use reverse() function
  - Added proper null checking for date field

## Testing
The following functionality should now work correctly:
1. ✅ Navigation to Week Operations & Diagram from logbook detail
2. ✅ Creating, editing, and deleting operations
3. ✅ Updating activity diagrams
4. ✅ Saving settings form with date field
5. ✅ Proper redirects after form submissions
6. ✅ Batch entry creation
7. ✅ Logbook generation/printing

## Impact
- Eliminates NoReverseMatch errors that were breaking the application
- Ensures settings form data is properly saved
- Improves code maintainability by using Django's URL reverse function
- Provides better user experience with correct redirects

## Additional Improvements Made

### 4. Entry Update URL Fix
**Problem**: Entry update links were using incorrect URL name `'logbook_entry'`.

**Solution**: Fixed the URL reference in `templates/logbook/logbook_detail.html`:
- Changed `{% url 'logbook_entry' logbook.id entry.id %}` to `{% url 'entry_update' logbook.id entry.id %}`

### 5. Document Generation Error Handling
**Problem**: The logbook generation function could fail with a FileNotFoundError without proper error handling.

**Solution**: Added try-catch error handling in `logbook/views.py`:
```python
try:
    generated_document = mlfieldbook(department, student_name, reg_no, company, week_no, from_date, to_date, activity_dict, operation_list, activity_diagram)
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    return HttpResponse(
        f"Error generating logbook document<br>"
        "The generated file could not be found. Please check if the output directory exists.",
        status=500
    )
```

This provides a user-friendly error message when document generation fails due to missing output directory or file issues.
